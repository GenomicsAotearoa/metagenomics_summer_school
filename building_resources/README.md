# Introduction

This is a little behind-the-scenes of how the materials were created for this workshop. As with most things bioinformatic, this is only the final, working, set of data and commands that were used to build the resources and training material. I would like to say that this all ran perfectly on the first try, but... well... science doesn't work that way.
