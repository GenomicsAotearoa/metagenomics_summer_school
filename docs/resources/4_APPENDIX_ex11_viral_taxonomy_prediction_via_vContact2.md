# APPENDIX (ex11) : Viral taxonomy prediction via *vContact2*

Prior to running this, you need to have run VirSorter2 and CheckV as indicated [here](../day2/ex10.1_viruses.md).

## 1. Predict genes via *prodigal-gv*

Prodigal-gv is a variant of prodigal that has been modified to improve gene calling for giant viruses and viruses that use alternative genetic codes. More information is available [here](https://github.com/apcamargo/prodigal-gv).

!!! note "Note"

    If you have already run DRAM-v to annotate viral genes, DRAM-v runs prodigal-gv in the background, so you can also use the genes.faa file generated by DRAM-v as input for vConTACT2 here.

!!! terminal "code"

    ```bash
    # Navigate to working directory
    cd /nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/MGSS_U/<YOUR FOLDER>/7.viruses

    # Create output directory
    mkdir -p viral_taxonomy

    # Create combined nucleotide sequence file
    cat checkv_out/*.fna > checkv_combined.fna
    ```

Example slurm script:

!!! terminal "code"

    ```bash linenums="1"
    #!/bin/bash -e

    #SBATCH --account       nesi02659
    #SBATCH --job-name      prodigal
    #SBATCH --partition     milan
    #SBATCH --time          00:05:00
    #SBATCH --mem           1GB
    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task 2
    #SBATCH --error         %x_%j.err
    #SBATCH --output        %x_%j.out


    # Load dependencies
    module purge
    module load prodigal-gv/2.9.0-GCC-11.3.0

    # Set up working directories
    cd /nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/MGSS_U/<YOUR FOLDER>/7.viruses

    # Run Prodigal-gv to predict viral genes 
    prodigal-gv -p meta -q \
             -i checkv_combined.fna \
             -a viral_taxonomy/checkv_combined.faa 
    ```

## 2. Generate required mapping file for `vContact2`

Use `vContact2`'s `vcontact2_gene2genome` script to generate the required mapping file from the output of `prodigal`.

!!! terminal "code"

    ```bash
    # Ensure you are in the correct working directory
    cd /nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/MGSS_U/<YOUR FOLDER>/7.viruses
    
    # Load modules
    module purge
    module unload XALT
    module load Apptainer/1.2.5 \
            MCL/14.137-gimkl-2020a \
            DIAMOND/2.1.9-GCC-11.3.0
    
    # All NeSI Filesystems are pre-bound to APPTAINER_BIND
    container=/opt/nesi/containers/vContact2
    
    # Run script
    apptainer run $container/vcontact2.simg \
    vcontact2_gene2genome --proteins viral_taxonomy/checkv_combined.faa \
                          --output viral_taxonomy/viral_genomes_g2g.csv \
                          -s 'Prodigal-FAA'
    ```

## 3. Run `vContact2`

!!! terminal "code"

    ```bash linenums="1"
    #!/bin/bash -e
    
    #SBATCH --account       nesi02659
    #SBATCH --job-name      vConTACT2
    #SBATCH --partition     milan
    #SBATCH --time          02:00:00
    #SBATCH --mem           20GB
    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task 16
    #SBATCH --error         %x_%j.err
    #SBATCH --output        %x_%j.out
    
    # Working directory
    cd /nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/MGSS_U/<YOUR FOLDER>/7.viruses

    # Load modules
    module purge
    module unload XALT
    module load Apptainer/1.2.5 \
            MCL/14.137-gimkl-2020a \
            DIAMOND/2.1.9-GCC-11.3.0

    # Bind paths
    container=/opt/nesi/containers/vContact2

    # Run vConTACT2
    apptainer run $container/vcontact2.simg \
    vcontact2 --raw-proteins viral_taxonomy/checkv_combined.faa \
              --rel-mode Diamond \
              --threads $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK \
              --proteins-fp viral_taxonomy/viral_genomes_g2g.csv \
              --db 'ProkaryoticViralRefSeq201-Merged' \
              --c1-bin /opt/conda/bin/cluster_one-1.0.jar \
              --output-dir vConTACT2_Results
    ```

## 4. Predict taxonomy of viral contigs based on output of `vContact2`

`vContact2` doesn't actually *assign* taxonomy to your input viral contigs. It instead provides an output outlining which reference viral genomes your viral contigs clustered with (if they clustered with any at all). Based on how closely they clustered with any reference genome(s), you can then use this to *predict* the likely taxonomy of the contig. 

From the `vContact2` online docs:

!!! quote ""

    One important note is that the taxonomic information is not included for user sequences. This means that each user will need to find their genome(s) of interest and check to see if reference genomes are located in the same VC. If the user genome is within the same VC sub-cluster as a reference genome, then there's a very high probability that the user genome is part of the same genus. If the user genome is in the same VC but not the same sub-cluster as a reference, then it's highly likely the two genomes are related at roughly genus-subfamily level. If there are no reference genomes in the same VC or VC sub-cluster, then it's likely that they are not related at the genus level at all.

The summary output of `vContact2` is the file `vConTACT2_Results/genome_by_genome_overview.csv`. As the comment above notes, one approach would be to search this file for particular contigs of interest, and see if any reference genomes fall into the same viral cluster (VC), using this reference to predict the taxonomy of the contig of interest.

The following `python` script is effectively an automated version of this for all input contigs (*Note: this script has not been widely tested, and so should be used with some degree of caution*). This script groups together contigs (and reference genomes) that fall into each VC, and then for each, outputs a list of all taxonomies (at the ranks of 'Order', 'Family', and 'Genus', separately) that were found in that cluster. The predictions (i.e. the list of all taxonomies found in the same VC) for each rank and each contig is output to the table `tax_predict_table.txt`. 

!!! note "Note"

    The taxonomies are deliberately enclosed in square brackets (`[ ]`) to highlight the fact that these are **predictions**, rather than definitive taxonomy **assignments**.

For future reference, a copy of this script is available for download [here](../scripts/tax_predict_vConTACT2_0.9.19.py)

!!! note "Note"

    This script was written for vConTACT2_0.9.19 and vConTACT2_0.11.3, and has not been tested with later versions. 

A comparable script for earlier versions of vConTACT2 is available [here](../scripts/vcontact2_tax_predict.py)

!!! terminal "code"

    ```bash
    module purge
    module load Python/3.11.6-foss-2023a
    
    cd /nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/MGSS_U/<YOUR FOLDER>/7.viruses/
    
    ./tax_predict_vConTACT2_0.9.19.py \
    -i vConTACT2_Results/genome_by_genome_overview.csv \
    -o vConTACT2_Results/
    ```
