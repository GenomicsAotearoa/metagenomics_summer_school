# Appendix (ex11): viral taxonomy prediction via *vContact2*

*NOTE: these steps are based on having `vContact2` set up as a `conda` environment. This documentation will be updated should `vContact2` become available as a NeSI module.*

Further information for installing and running of vContact2 can also be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/MAVERICLab/vcontact2/src/master/).

**1. Predict genes via `prodigal`**

```bash
cd /nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/MGSS_U/<YOUR FOLDER>/8.coverage_and_taxonomy
```

Example slurm script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash -e
#SBATCH -A nesi02659
#SBATCH -J prodigal
#SBATCH --time 00:05:00
#SBATCH --mem=1GB
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=2
#SBATCH -e prodigal.err
#SBATCH -o prodigal.out
#SBATCH --export NONE

export SLURM_EXPORT_ENV=ALL

# Load dependencies
module purge
module load Prodigal/2.6.3-GCC-9.2.0

# Set up working directories
cd /nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/MGSS_U/<YOUR FOLDER>/8.coverage_and_taxonomy

mkdir -p viral_taxonomy

# Run main analyses 
srun prodigal -p meta -q \
-i checkv_combined.fna \
-a viral_taxonomy/checkv_combined.faa 
```

**2. Generate required mapping file for `vContact2`**

Use `vContact2`'s `vcontact2_gene2genome` script to generate the required mapping file from the output of `prodigal`.

*NOTE: update `/path/to/conda/envs/vContact2/bin` in the below script to the appropraite path.*

```bash
# activate vcontact2 conda environment
module purge
module load Miniconda3
source activate vContact2

# Load dependencies
export PATH="/path/to/conda/envs/vContact2/bin:$PATH"
module load DIAMOND/0.9.32-GCC-9.2.0
module load MCL/14.137-gimkl-2020a

# run vcontact2_gene2genome
vcontact2_gene2genome -p viral_taxonomy/checkv_combined.faa -o viral_taxonomy/viral_genomes_g2g.csv -s 'Prodigal-FAA'

# deactivate conda environment
conda deactivate
```

**3. Run `vContact2`**

Example slurm script:

*NOTE: update `/path/to/conda/envs/vContact2/bin` and `/path/to/conda/envs/vContact2/bin/cluster_one-1.0.jar` in the below script to the appropraite paths.*

```bash
#!/bin/bash -e
#SBATCH -A nesi02659
#SBATCH -J vcontact2
#SBATCH --time 02:00:00
#SBATCH --mem=20GB
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=20
#SBATCH -e vcontact2.err
#SBATCH -o vcontact2.out
#SBATCH --export NONE

export SLURM_EXPORT_ENV=ALL

# Set up working directories
cd /nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/MGSS_U/<YOUR FOLDER>/8.coverage_and_taxonomy/viral_taxonomy/

# activate vcontact2 conda environment
module purge
module load Miniconda3
source activate vContact2

# Load dependencies
export PATH="/path/to/conda/envs/vContact2/bin:$PATH"
module load DIAMOND/0.9.32-GCC-9.2.0
module load MCL/14.137-gimkl-2020a

# Run vcontact2
srun vcontact2 \
-t 20 \
--raw-proteins checkv_combined.faa \
--rel-mode Diamond \
--proteins-fp viral_genomes_g2g.csv \
--db 'ProkaryoticViralRefSeq201-Merged' \
--c1-bin /path/to/conda/envs/vContact2/bin/cluster_one-1.0.jar \
--output-dir vConTACT2_Results

# deactivate conda environment
conda deactivate
```

**4. Predict taxonomy of viral contigs based on ouput of `vContact2`**

`vContact2` doesn't actually *assign* taxonomy to your input viral contigs. It instead provides an output outlining which reference viral genomes your viral contigs clustered with (if they clustered with any at all). Based on how closely they clustered with any reference genome(s), you can then use this to *predict* the likely taxonomy of the contig. 

From the `vContact2` online docs:

> One important note is that the taxonomic information is not included for user sequences. This means that each user will need to find their genome(s) of interest and check to see if reference genomes are located in the same VC. If the user genome is within the same VC subcluster as a reference genome, then there's a very high probability that the user genome is part of the same genus. If the user genome is in the same VC but not the same subcluster as a reference, then it's highly likely the two genomes are related at roughly genus-subfamily level. If there are no reference genomes in the same VC or VC subcluster, then it's likely that they are not related at the genus level at all.

The summary output of `vContact2` is the file `vConTACT2_Results/genome_by_genome_overview.csv`. As the comment above notes, one approach would be to search this file for particular contigs of interest, and see if any reference genomes fall into the same viral cluster (VC), using this reference to predict the taxonomy of the contig of interest.

The following `python` script is effectively an automated version of this for all input contigs (*Note: this script has not been widely tested, and so should be used with some degree of caution*). This script groups together contigs (and reference genomes) that fall into each VC, and then for each, outputs a list of all taxonomies (at the ranks of 'Order', 'Family', and 'Genus', separately) that were found in that cluster. The predictions (i.e. the list of all taxonomies found in the same VC) for each rank and each contig is output to the table `tax_predict_table.txt`. 

*NOTE: The taxonomies are deliberately enclosed in square brackets (`[ ]`) to highlight the fact that these are **predictions**, rather than definitive taxonomy **assignments**.*

For future reference, a copy of this script is available for download [here](https://github.com/GenomicsAotearoa/metagenomics_summer_school/blob/master/materials/scripts/vcontact2_tax_predict.py)

```bash
module purge
module load Python/3.8.2-gimkl-2020a

cd /nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/MGSS_U/<YOUR FOLDER>/8.coverage_and_taxonomy/

./vcontact2_tax_predict.py \
-i viral_taxonomy/vConTACT2_Results/genome_by_genome_overview.csv \
-o viral_taxonomy/
```
